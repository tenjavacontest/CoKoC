Couldn't make it in time because I had lots of things to do that day.

The idea of the plugin was to create diagrams showing the number of mobs around the player rendered on maps (in-game maps). I had other feature ideas, like creating a line graph of the number of mobs of a certain type over type or being able to set zones for which the data would be recorded.

That would've been useful to test the efficiency of mob farms while staying in the game.

But yeah, another time.
